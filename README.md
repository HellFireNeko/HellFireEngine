# HellFireEngine
A custom game engine built using [MonoGame.Extended](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended) as a big reference, and [Microsoft.Xna.Framework via MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) as the building blocks

Keep in mind this game engine is heavily work in progress, and features may come and go, so expect to have to change often as i update it.

# To do:
  - [ ] Setup the physics system
  - [ ] Handle all collisions
  - [ ] Allow for child objects on the game object system
  - [ ] Error testing, lots and lots of error testing
  - [ ] Create some documentation.

# HellFireEngine
A custom game engine built using MonoGame.Extended as a big reference, and Microsoft.Xna.Framework as the building blocks

Keep in mind this game engine is heavily work in progress, and features may come and go, so expect to have to change often as i update it.

# To do:
  [] Setup the physics system
  [] Handle all collisions
  [] Allow for child objects on the game object system
  [] Error testing, lots and lots of error testing
